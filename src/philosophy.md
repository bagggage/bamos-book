# Philosophy

The philosophy of BamOS is centered around the pursuit of simplicity and purity.

Discussions about code purity, performance, and other similar topics can go on endlessly, often without reaching any significant conclusion.

Therefore, when we speak of **purity** and **simplicity** within this project, it should be understood as an *idealized*,
*mathematical* model—something we strive towards but will likely *never fully achieve*.
This creates a continuous process of movement and change, allowing us to avoid stagnation.

BamOS is not about business or marketing; it’s about **technology**, **rationality**, and accessibility for everyone.

## Premises

The field of information technology—from microchips and hardware to web applications—is filled with imperfect solutions
and non-technical factors (*AND THAT’S OK*). Most software is proprietary and designed to quickly meet
the needs of the end user with the goal of out-earning competitors. Business sets the rules, and in the end,
**quality** in technology is often a strong recommendation but not a strict rule. It’s not just businesses
that contribute to subpar software quality; open-source software is also far from perfect, but this doesn’t imply ill intent or laziness
on the part of developers—every system has its sharp and smooth edges, and every project has its reasons.

There is a lot of software that **could be** and **can be** better, faster, more efficient, and more accessible.
Even large and well-known software products are not always great in this regard. And this provides motivation: the opportunity
to influence the current state of affairs, contribute to improvements, and maybe even change the world
for the better—or perhaps *become one of those hundreds of thousands of projects that
gather dust across the internet, never seeing their moment of glory*. No one knows where this will lead ;)
