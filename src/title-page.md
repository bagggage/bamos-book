# The BamOS

It is open-source operating system project with
it's own kernel.

This documentation will help you better understand the functioning of the OS, the structure of the project, and its conceptual foundation.

## In short

The main goal is to develop a fast and multifunctional OS that will be compatible with user applications built for other systems (primarily GNU/Linux and Windows). Despite this, it should remain as simple and concise as possible.

Other important aspects include the cleanliness and simplicity of the code itself, having good documentation, and maximum accessibility. These should become distinctive features of BamOS.

> It is important to understand that this is an evolving project, and therefore, many aspects may change. As a result, the documentation may not always include information about the latest updates. To help navigate and track changes in the project, a separate [**page**](./current-progress.md) is provided.
